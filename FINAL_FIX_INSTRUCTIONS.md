# FINAL FIX - RUN THESE 2 SCRIPTS

## âœ… Everything is Fixed! Just Run These SQL Scripts:

### 1. **Run First** (Full Admin Access):
```sql
/home/vboxuser/TOP/kamisoft-app/scripts/027_full_admin_access.sql
```
This disables RLS so you can freely create/edit/delete all content.

### 2. **Run Second** (Schema Fixes):
```sql
/home/vboxuser/TOP/kamisoft-app/scripts/028_final_schema_fixes.sql
```
This adds missing `display_order`, `content`, `description` columns to case_studies.
